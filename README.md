From the above visualization we see that the number of bikes at 0 minutes start to increase with an initial value of roughly 38K and then reaches a peak value of 150K at the first 10 mins of trip duration and later on the number of bikes get decreased slowly as the number of hours increase.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81202523/134088123-8f9e0a1a-cfd1-4683-b30b-346781eaf454.png)

From the above visualization we observe that the number of bikes of males in the first 10 mins of trip duration increases to 150K to its peak value and then starts to decreases. We observe that for female, the peak value reached is 35K in the first 10 mins .![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81202523/134088181-691a6026-3b35-4ffb-824c-4beb7b42b5ec.png)

This visualization shows trip duration with respect to gender on each weekday and with respect to hour. From the visualization, we see that Males have more number of bikes trip duration during Monday to Friday the most and again on Saturday having busy times between 7AM -8PM. 
Then comes females with more number of bikes trip duration between Monday and Saturday with least on Sunday. Busy times are between 7AM- 9AM and 5PM- 8PM.

This visualization is on user type and their bike trip duration on weekdays with respect of gender. We observe that for 'Customer' type with 'Unknown' Gender has more trip duration on Saturdays . We observe that for 'Subscriber' type with 'Male ' Gender has more trip duration on Thursday and then Friday little less, then comes Monday and Tuesday with least on Sunday. The 'female ' with Subscriber usertype had more trip durations on Monday, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.

The two additional visualizations are:

The above chart shows another way of representing count of gender with respect to hour of start time. This chart shows that Male are always in higher count at 7-8AM and 4-7 Pm roughly. The highest peak value is 149K for males at 5-7PM. Then comes ‘females’ with higher count than ‘unknown’ category of gender.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81202523/134088292-c8a089eb-0101-4d5e-b62c-50bfcdce4107.png)

This visualization shows that the people are highly concentrated in the end station’s having Id between 0-500, 2000 and 3000-3500. Again in this we observe that males are more in number than ‘females’ and ‘unknown’ . It might be that those are densely populated areas or they are other suburban cities. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81202523/134088320-58659738-2053-4b0e-848d-8f6ad8d34ec7.png)
